The Sun <br>
A poem by Vee Quarkstar ● <a href="https://twitter.com/entirebiass">Twitter</a><br>
<br>
i haven’t looked at the sun for so long, i’d forgotten how much it hurts to <br>
the sun is bright, they give me life, but they burn my eyes <br>
<br>
my first love was the sun <br>
the suns rays warmed me in a way they do not know <br>
the suns light awakened the light inside of me <br>
if it weren't for the sun, i would not be a star now <br>
shining my rays into space, someday to become the sun of my own solar system <br>
<br>
the yellow sun burns it’s saccharine longing into my pupils <br>
a mother and father to me, their rays scold my skin and heart in ways only a sun could <br>
every cell in my body fears the sun <br>
their poisonous rays scorching my being in ways only a sun could <br>
the sun hurts to love <br>
and every small imperfection makes me fear that i am not enough for the sun <br>
and every mistake makes me fear that i am not enough for the sun <br>
and every slip of the tongue makes me fear that i am not enough for the sun <br>
<br>
then the sun was gone, and i became undone <br>
myself becoming dust without a sun to keep me grounded <br>
the worry becoming dust without a sun to keep me confused <br>
a katamari rolling through space, one without a sun <br>
that ball of dust would eventually become a moon for the sun <br>
not only for the sun, but for themselves as well <br>
reflecting the sun's rays back into the patchwork sky all around them <br>
<br>
some things in life will always eventually come rolling back, like the sun rising in the day <br>
and the moon rising at night, these two found themselves and ought to find something <br>
more together, or perhaps it’s all just nonsense, dust in space, words on a screen <br>
