<br>
Dance and stretch, <br>
Stretch into a smile<br>
Make myself look fake<br>
But not just my face:<br>
My body; my soul<br>
<br>
Let’s get away from these despicable people,<br>
Into your pupils my smile will<br>
<br>
Shrink down into<br>
The rest of the crowd <br>
Blend in, become <br>
A sweaty mess<br>
What have we become?<br>
Waiting to die but rushing through life <br>
And who have I become?<br>
Just another face in the crowd<br>
<br>
And I don’t think I can go to sleep yet<br>
No, I don’t think I can go to sleep yet<br>
The night’s still young <br>
As long as I’m awake,<br>
The night’s still young<br>
<br>
The night gets old <br>
But I don’t want to sleep yet <br>
No, I don’t think I want to sleep yet<br>
I don’t want to dream,<br>
Dreaming is dying while you’re alive<br>
<br>
Don an expensive outfit<br>
Something you know you can’t afford<br>
If you don’t post about it<br>
Did it really happen?<br>
<br>
It’s a big night<br>
But the same size as all the others<br>
In the waning moonlight<br>
Sit the lovers,<br>
Toasting to things that end so soon<br>
<br>
Wear your crown of pride,<br>
Wear it, oh so timid <br>
<br>
We’ve gotten away with life,<br>
Sentenced to die for all our life <br>
Let us go then,<br>
You and I<br>
You told me you were my friend<br>
Forever,<br>
You didn’t have to lie<br>
<br>
It’s not your fault- life doesn’t last forever<br>
We’re doomed to die forever,<br>
But I’m not dead<br>
No, I’m not dead <br>
I never liked sleeping with strangers<br>
<br>
I watched the sinners stumble,<br>
Shuffle around and grumble;<br>
I watched, pointed, and condemned. <br>
As I stumbled home I laughed <br>
Because I wasn’t at all like them. <br>
